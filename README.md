Release Action
==============
This is an Android Layout Library provides Release-To-Action like PullToRefresh.
The mechanism is similar to SwipeRefreshLayout.
You just wrap a target View or Layout with ReleaseActionLayout and setup listeners and pulled-views.
Then it'll fire actions when you release your finger after swiping.
